Assignment: A 3-stage (FDX) super-scalar implementation of the C16 architecture.

We will make some simplifying assumptions:

- only support the "add" and "sub" instructions (f=0, f=1)
- no branching
- no memory instructions

Memory is still word (16-bit) addressable but is 32-bit wide. The design
with the highest steady-state IPC wins.
