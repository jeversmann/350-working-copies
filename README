Assignment:  Implement a a scoreboard in the style of the the CDC6600
for a subset of our C16 instructions

Stages:

    - Fetch
    - D1 : decode, issue, WAW stalls, structural hazards
    - D2 : read operands, RAW hazards
    - X (depends on the functional unit)
    - WB, WAR hazards

Instruction subset:

    - Integer add / subtract
    - memory load / store
    - no branches

Functional units:

    - be creative
    - simplify your memory design and take as many cycles as you need to compute the effective
      address and load from memory

The CDC 6600 scoreboard is described starting at page 125 in Thornton's excellent book
