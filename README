Objective: Work on your Verilog and design skills

Assignment: Edit clock.v and add the following functionality:

- Show the elapsed time since your design was loaded
    * HEX3:HEX2 display minutes in decimal
    * HEX1:HEX0 display seconds in decimal

- KEY0 sets the elapsed time to 0000

- KEY1 freezes the display at the current time. Counting continues while
  the key is depressed and the correct time is shown when the key is released

- KEY2 runs the time at 10x speed (the seconds advance once every 1/10 of a
  second)

- KEY3 sets the elapsed time to 5900
